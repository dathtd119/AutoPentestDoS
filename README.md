# Automated Pentest System for DoS/DDoS

This is a web-based automated pentest system specifically designed for Denial of Service (DoS) and Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks.

  


# Overview

The primary purpose of this software is to automate the process of **Penetration-Testing for DoS/DDoS** attacks. It was developed as a graduation project, aiming to simplify and streamline the manual pentesting tasks while providing a scalable platform for incorporating additional attack tools in the future.

# Features

- Automated pentesting for DoS/DDoS attacks

- Simple and user-friendly interface

- Extensible architecture for integrating additional attack tools




# Tech Stack

## Frontend
- React Native

- [Tamagui Library](https://github.com/tamagui/tamagui)

## Backend
- Node.js

- Express.js

#### Integrated Tools
The backend utilizes the following tools:
- nmap (Directly on Kali Linux)
- [vdjagilev/nmap-formatter](https://github.com/vdjagilev/nmap-formatter)
- searchsploit (Directly on Kali Linux)
- [cvemap](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/cvemap)
- hping3 (Directly on Kali Linux)
- [MHDDoS](https://github.com/MatrixTM/MHDDoS)




# Getting Started

### Prerequisites

###### Both Back End & Front End package manager
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) **or** [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

###### Back End
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (v18 or later)


### Frontend Setup

The frontend can be run on Windows or Linux. Follow these steps to set up and run the frontend:

1. Navigate to the `front` folder:
    
    `cd front`
    
2. Install the required dependencies:
    
    Using npm `npm install` Or , using Yarn `yarn install`
    
3. Start the development server:
    
    Using npm `npm run web ` Or , using Yarn `yarn web`
    

The frontend will start running on `http://localhost:3000`.


### Backend Setup

**Note:** For best results, it is recommended to run the backend on a **Linux environment**, such as `WSL 2` (Windows Subsystem for Linux) or a `Linux virtual machine`.

1. Navigate to the `back` folder:
    
    `cd back`
    
2. Install the required dependencies:
    
    `npm install`
    
3. Start the backend server:
    
    `npm run start`
    

The backend will start running on `http://localhost:3001`.
- *You can configure this in the code*

**Note:** If you encounter any issues related to missing dependencies or tools (e.g., nmap, nmap-formatter, searchsploit, cvemap, hping3, mhddos), you may need to install them separately on your Linux environment.
